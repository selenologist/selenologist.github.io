I'm a programmer, musician and electronics experimenter from Australia. I run Linux and write basically every programming language in existence to do what I need to do. Sometimes I write about it here!

I'm particularly interested in Digital Signal Processing and synthesizers, and I contribute to [Surge Synthesizer](https://surge-synthesizer.github.io/) and [related projects](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/).

I've also written a lot of network and security software, device drivers, embedded systems software, etc, as well as some hobby video games on a variety of platforms. Although I'm early gen Z, I learned programming on a Commodore 64 and take an interest in computer internals and optimisation.

Another interest of mine is human languages, and I've written various tools to help manage language information. I speak English as my native language, but I've studied Spanish, German, Japanese and Mandarin.

I'm very shy, and for security and safety reasons I've made a habit of living behind anonymous handles. I've let a lot of things slip by, but most importantly I'd like to stop information being lost. So I'd like to document my projects and my solutions to various problems here. I hope they can be helpful to someone else!
